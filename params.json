The approach used by the library can be summarised as follows:\r\n * Each actor within the simulation is represented as a Process.\r\n * Processes perform work, and each item of work is represented by an Instruction.\r\n * The completion of each instruction is an event that changes the state of the simulation.\r\n * The progress of the simulation is regulated by a Simulator.\r\n * A SimulationContext is used to make shared data available across the simulation.\r\n\r\n###Guide\r\nThe NSimulate guide can be read [here](./guide/index.html)\r\n\r\n###Examples\r\nThe following examples are provided to illustrate the usage and capabilities of the library.\r\n * [Workshop with unreliable machines](./example/workshop.html)\r\n * [Call Center with call escalation](./example/callcenter.html)\r\n * [Order delivery with warehouse reorder](./example/orderdelivery.html)\r\n\r\n###License and Usage\r\nNSimulate is available based on an MIT style license.  It can be used for commercial and non-commercial use.  The license can be read [here](./LICENCE.txt).\r\n\r\n###Feedback\r\nIf you are using NSimulate, any feedback or suggestions are welcome. @phillp\r\n","name":"NSimulate"}
